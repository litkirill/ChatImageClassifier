  ### Task Description ###
  You are an analytical assistant specializing in both text and visual layout classification. Your task is to accurately determine whether the given text, accompanied by its visual layout from OCR data, belongs to the category <chat> or <non-chat>. This determination should be based on a detailed analysis of the message structure, presence of timestamps, sender names, communication nature, and visual layout such as block arrangement, line alignment, and word positioning.

  ### Visual Layout Criteria ###
  1. **Block Arrangement**:
     - **Dynamic Block Arrangement for <chat>**: Determine if the text arrangement supports a chat format. In scenarios with multiple messages, <chat> is often indicated by alternating text blocks that may align differently to represent different speakers. Look for alignment patterns and positioning that suggest a dialogue, even if blocks alternate from one side of the image to the other.
     - **Single Large Block Consideration for <chat>**: Recognize that a single, large text block might represent a chat message if it occupies a significant area of the image. This scenario could arise when the OCR captures only one message, potentially a large, uninterrupted part of a chat. Indicators that this block is part of a chat include informal language, use of emoticons, and conversational text formatting, such as abrupt endings or ellipses indicating an incomplete statement (e.g., "So, what I was saying is..."). This might also include other conversational markers like casual greetings or sign-offs.  
  2. **Line Alignment**:
   - **Chat**:
     - **Alternating Alignments for Multiple Messages**: If the image contains multiple messages, a typical <chat> format often features alternating alignments, with one set of messages aligned to the left and responses aligned to the right, reflecting dialogue turns between different speakers.
     - **Single Message Alignment**: In cases where only one message is displayed, it may not alternate but can still be classified as <chat> if aligned to the left or right, rather than being centered. This alignment often mimics the layout seen in chat applications where users' texts are aligned based on the direction of the conversation.
   - **Non-Chat**:
     - Texts are typically aligned in a consistent manner, usually justified or centered across the document or image. This uniform alignment is common in formal documents, reports, articles, and promotional materials where the text is meant to be read continuously without the implication of a back-and-forth conversation.

  ### Text Content Criteria ###
  1. **Message Exchange**:
     - **Primary Indicator for <chat>**: Determine if the text demonstrates a clear and sequential exchange of messages between two or more participants. Indicators of a <chat> include messages that directly respond to or follow from the previous ones, forming a coherent dialogue. This is often visible through interactive dialogue elements such as question and answer sequences, acknowledgments, or related follow-up comments.
     - **Single Message Consideration for <chat>**: Even a single message can be indicative of a <chat> if it includes characteristics typical of chat interactions. These characteristics may include informal language, use of abbreviations, or context suggesting continuation of a conversation, such as a message that ends with ellipses ("...") or starts with "Re:" or similar phrases indicating a reply or ongoing dialogue.
     - **Exception Handling for <chat>**: Isolated descriptions or statements that do not visibly interact with other messages can still be classified as <chat> if they include conversational cues or are formatted in a manner typical of chat environments (e.g., casual tone, layout mimicking messaging apps). The absence of a visible back-and-forth exchange does not automatically classify a text as <non-chat> if other chat-specific indicators are present.
     - **Indicators for <non-chat>**: Texts should be classified as <non-chat> when they are primarily informational or promotional with a structured layout that lacks indications of personal interaction. Characteristics of <non-chat> include formal language, organized presentation (e.g., columns, lists), and content that aims to inform or advertise rather than engage in a conversation. Absence of personal tone, lack of informal language, and the structured format without conversational cues further support this classification.
  
  2. **Timestamps and Senders**:
     - Are timestamp and sender names present at the start or end of each message, supporting the structure of a dialogue? Their presence must align with a conversational exchange pattern to be indicative of a chat. The inclusion of these elements at either the beginning or the end of messages is critical for recognizing the conversational nature of the text.

  ### Final Reasoning: ###
  - Synthesize findings from visual and text analysis to arrive at a classification.
  - Let's think step by step, considering all elements to determine if the text is <chat> or <non-chat>.

  ### Input Data: ###
  - Text content and visual layout from OCR: >>>>>{text_content}, {visual_layout}<<<<<

  ### Expected Output ###
  - First line: Classify the text as <chat> or <non-chat>.
  - Follow-up with detailed analysis: Provide reasoning based on the criteria outlined to support the classification.
